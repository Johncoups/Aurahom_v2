IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
-----------------------
Since this is a DIY phase, provide HIGH-LEVEL project planning guidance that helps users understand what they need to plan for, research, and prepare. Focus on planning considerations and quality control tasks, but avoid detailed step-by-step execution procedures.

Format your response as a COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT PLANNING GUIDE that helps users understand what they need to plan for each phase. Focus on high-level planning, not detailed execution steps.

STRUCTURE YOUR RESPONSE AS:
---------------------------
1. **OVERALL PROJECT TIMELINE** - High-level estimate from current phase to completion
2. **INDIVIDUAL PHASE TIMELINES** - Use the provided timeline estimates for each phase
3. **Phase Overview** - What this phase accomplishes and key considerations
4. **Planning Checklist** - What to research, decide, and prepare
5. **Quality & Safety** - Standards to understand and requirements to meet
6. **Timeline & Logistics** - **Total time estimate (REQUIRED for every phase)**, weather considerations, and seasonal timing
7. **Professional Guidance** - When to hire vs. DIY and what to look for
8. **Next Phase Preparation** - What to prepare for the following phase

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
----------------------
**CRITICAL**: Every single phase must include a total time estimate. For contractor phases, provide total time estimate in weeks/months.

**IMPORTANT**: Use the provided individual phase timeline estimates above when discussing each phase. These estimates are based on the user's specific project details including construction method, foundation type, house size, number of stories, and target start date.
