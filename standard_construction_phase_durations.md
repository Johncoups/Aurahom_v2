# Construction Phase Duration Standards

*Note: Durations are typical ranges for average residential construction (2,000-3,500 sq ft). Actual times vary based on house size, complexity, crew size, weather, and local conditions.*

## Key Factors Affecting Durations

### Weather Dependencies
- Foundation, roofing, exterior work, and concrete phases heavily weather-dependent
- Winter construction can add 20-40% to timeline in northern climates

### Crew Size Impact
- Framing: 2-person crew vs 6-person crew can double/halve timeframes
- Specialty trades less affected by crew size

### House Size Multipliers
- Under 1,500 sq ft: 0.7x multiplier
- 1,500-2,500 sq ft: 1.0x (baseline)
- 2,500-4,000 sq ft: 1.3x multiplier  
- Over 4,000 sq ft: 1.6x+ multiplier

### Complexity Factors
- Custom vs production: Custom adds 25-50% to timeline
- Architectural details: Complex trim/millwork can double finish phase times
- Systems complexity: Smart home, radiant floors, complex HVAC add time

### Regional Variations
- Rural areas: Material delivery delays, fewer contractors
- Urban areas: Permit delays, parking/access issues
- High-demand markets: Contractor availability affects scheduling

## Critical Path Considerations

**Longest typical sequences:**
1. Traditional Frame: Foundation → Framing → Roofing → Rough-ins → Finishes
2. Weather delays most commonly affect: Site prep, foundation, roofing, exterior work
3. Inspection delays most common at: Foundation, framing, rough-ins, final

**Parallel work opportunities:**
- Exterior finishes can overlap with interior rough-ins
- Paint and trim often overlap
- Some finish work can parallel kitchen/bath installation
