NOTES
================================================================================

- SIP (Structural Insulated Panels) construction uses the same phases as Post-Frame
- Modular construction uses the same phases as Traditional Frame
- Each construction method has different phase sequences and dependencies
- Phase IDs are used in the system for identification and relationships
- The order field indicates the recommended construction sequence
- Dependencies show which phases must be completed before others can begin

================================================================================
USAGE IN SYSTEM
================================================================================

These phase IDs are used in:
- Timeline estimation prompts
- DIY phase selection
- Construction sequence planning
- Phase dependency mapping
- Progress tracking
