# Post-Purchase Build Roadmap (UAT-friendly)

Use this file to plan, execute, and UAT your build. Check items off by editing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in your editor. In some viewers checkboxes aren’t clickable; editing the file is the reliable way to track progress.

- Conventions: `[ ]` not started · `[x]` done · Add dates/notes inline like `(planned 2025-08-20 / actual 2025-09-02)`
- Each phase includes: detailed tasks, questions to ask vendors, and info vendors need from you.

## Start Here
- Complete the kickoff checklist: [KICKOFF_QUESTIONNAIRE.md](./KICKOFF_QUESTIONNAIRE.md)
- Then work through phases below. Each phase assumes the kickoff baseline is set.
