## WEATHER & SEASONAL CONSIDERATIONS

**IMPORTANT**: Consider the user's target start date and location when providing timeline guidance. Richmond City, VA experiences:
- **Spring (March-May)**: Ideal for foundation and framing work, moderate temperatures, some rain
- **Summer (June-August)**: Hot and humid, good for most work but challenging for concrete curing
- **Fall (September-November)**: Excellent working conditions, ideal for exterior work
- **Winter (December-February)**: Cold temperatures, potential snow/ice, challenging for concrete and exterior work

**Weather Impact on Timeline**: Each phase should include weather considerations and how seasonal changes may affect duration and scheduling.

**TIME ESTIMATES REQUIREMENT**: 
- **EVERY phase must include a total time estimate**
- **For DIY phases**: Provide both hours AND weeks (calculated from user's weekly commitment)
- **For contractor phases**: Provide total time estimate in weeks/months
- **Example**: If interior framing is 40-60 hours and user commits 20-30 hours/week, show "40-60 hours (2-3 weeks at 20-30 hours/week)"

## Why Detail Level Might Not Be Increasing

The enhanced detail system is implemented, but the AI might be:
1. **Truncating responses** due to token limits
2. **Not fully utilizing** the enhanced prompts
3. **Focusing on breadth** rather than depth
4. **Missing the granular task breakdowns**

## Current Prompt Structure

The prompt now includes:
- **6 project planning categories** (removed detailed execution steps)
- **Enhanced user profile** with house specifications
- **Construction method-specific phase sequences**
- **Richmond City, VA building codes** and inspection requirements
- **High-level planning guidance** rather than detailed execution steps
- **Professional guidance** on when to hire vs. DIY

## Next Steps

1. **Review the actual AI response** to see what's being generated
2. **Check if the enhanced prompts** are being fully utilized
3. **Verify the building code integration** is working
4. **Test the loop-based DIY phase generation** for maximum detail
5. **Consider adjusting the prompt** to emphasize depth over breadth

Would you like me to show you what the actual AI response looks like, or would you prefer to test it yourself first?
